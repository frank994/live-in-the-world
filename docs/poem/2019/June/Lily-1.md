# Lily

O Lily O Lily

How magic thy are

Thy made me fear

Be alone, or be lonely

Come with me, Lily 

Come with me,

Or I will die soonly.

I cannot compare anything

with thy, my Lily.

Thy are everything to me.

Thy are a fairy, yes my fairy

My everything

Smiling, laughing, moving, dancing

Thy already got me.

Got my heart ,my darling

And never show thy beauty.

 To anyone else, my darling.

Cuz I'm selfish noddy

Come with me, my luve.

My everything.

I will give you anything.
