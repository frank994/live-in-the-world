# Plan of Three Year

Because it's the tail of my work.

I faced three choices: 
 1. quit job and go to the tramp life. Live in a van and go to climbing travel.
 2. Find a new job and go fighting for it.
 3. Stay where u are.

For Option one: 
- DISADVANTAGE:
    - you will lost all the economic resources.
    - you have to restrict for you consumer desire.
- ADVANTAGE:
    - Go live with a period of free life.
    - Maybe get involve into climbing social club.

For Option Two:
- DISADVANTAGE:
    - Might won't find the same salary.
    - Still unhappy.(if you still think that's what u don't wanna do.)
- ADVANTAGE:
    - Get a new environment.
    - Get new opportunity to get higher position.(YES, U WANNA BE A HIGHER POSITION)

For Option Three:
- DISADVANTAGE:
    - Still unhappy.
    - For technique side, you have to study by yourself. And won't get the opportunity to use it.
- ADVANTAGE:
    - Can work 8 hours a day.
    - Salary is not bad.


### Stable Life

If you still wanna work stablely, you have to find where is the best city to live or invest.
Then you need to buy a house for the next three year's goal.

Get the diploma for definitely.

Find a girlfriend.

Still get the opportunity to travel aborad.

### Tramp Life

Extremely physical exercise.

Get high-altitude mountains.

Learn all the knowledge which need to become a alpine climber.

For the subjective sight: U can't bear the low-quality of life. U can not put all of ur energy to get the physical needy or exercise plan.






### BACK TO REALITY

It seems like OPTION TWO would be the most suitable for you.

For get there, you will need to put some effort to your technique skills learning.

And get some opportunity to talk with some foreigners.
