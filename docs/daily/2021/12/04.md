# The way to back hotel

## Skiing in today
distance: 50km
highest speed: 69km/h

Been through a high-speed fall in the lower part of Red Cable car piste.

Didn't satisfy with myself.

Felt weak about the right leg's strengh,


### To Impvoe

At morning for warm up you should take the piste: From the Gray Cable Car to the bottom of the skiing station.(tenth piste)


### Review

Wake up at 4am, such a long day.

but haven't read anything during the skiing, and did nothing for practice skiing's skill.

Trying to make some benefit from skiing itself, but in the end you've make a amigo with some stranger.(Don't like it)
