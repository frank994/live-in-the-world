最近心灵鸡汤看的老多了。

The requirement of social, the desire of sexuality makes me anxiety.

A lot of pressure from myself.

Always get down when there is no goal in the froeground.

Have been search a lof articles about gap year.

Will it, I mean, gap year makes me feel better?

If u can't self-control in the rest hour or spare time during work period.

How can u promise u will finish it out of work period.

Make your time valuable, make your ideas golden.

U have a lot of ideas.

For instance, 
No.1 is make a mini-program about Rock Climbing.
No.2 is make street photography about video in Shenzhen, try to relax some anxious people like urself.
