# Out of Quarantine

It's really strange to get the freedom again.

I mean, lost the physcal freedom is strange enough for me.

But the most scared thing is: we(a young person who lives in 21st century), have been controlled by the media or social or capital power already.

What you saw everyday, what you wanna to do everyday, what you did in the past time, they were all controlled by the capitalists or the political power.

For instance, the smartphone, the social apps and the news, the informations you get. Who controlled the future and will control the past, who controlled the present and controlled the future.


### Overview of the past three months.

It's been a while to quit my job as a free man, or lose man.

I got no idea what to do, what kind of girl I want and what kind of life that I want.
