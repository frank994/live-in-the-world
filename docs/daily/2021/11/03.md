# Company with families

I've spend three days with my families, with my grandma, my sister and my nephew, for specific.

It's really interesting to have a communication with grandma like a friend.

She has told me the old stories about hersel, her experiences, her attitude to life, to people, to small stuffs.

But without teaching, just telling, as a friend, or just take you as a listener.

I won't get that chance again, I knew it.
