# Waiiting for the plane to Altay

A....

All of my faithful embitious thoughts has gone, became the ash and dust.






### Thoughts

just came out from my mind.

take a series of it.

try to use 9 photos to tell a short story,( or even less than 9)

just tell to desribe something.

for yourself is the story itself.

for the audience, it should be the fantasy view or landscape or the experience.
