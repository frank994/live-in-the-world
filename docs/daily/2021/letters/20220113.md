# A Letter to Sansan

I did dreamed about you last night, Sansan.

Yes, again.

We lived in a house, "It's our place, just you and me." You told me so.

It's a lakeside house, the sun just came out, through the jalousie onto your curly hair.

You just took a shower, there were some waterdrop still remained inside your hair, shining, golden.

And you smiled, yes, you smiled to me, with your glamour smile, my heart can't stop beating up.

And I smelled, from the air, all the room, filled with your fragrance.

It is not just a dream, I knew it, for sure.

Someday, someday we'll meet at a lakeside house, just you and me.

And the sun will come out, through the shutters, onto your golden hair, shining.

You will stand in front of the window, and smile to me.
