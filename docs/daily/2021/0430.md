### One Sentence a Day

Find the aim and keep for it.


### Thinking
What is important is yourself.

### Things

I met the little Sprite again.

That was the plan. We'll have sex together.

But the fact is, we didn't do it. Actually, I didn't wanna do it.

The truth isn't that I do not have sexuality. But I just realized what I really want. Not just a girl.

I need a long-term partner. Which we will have the same interests, the same experiences, the same want-to-do list.

And more important thing is: I wanna be free, totally, mentally, physically, literally.

Self-discipline should always keep in my mind, and my habitual life.
