Never thought this would happened.
I think too much about other person's thought.
I should, just care about myself.
If you wanna go to climb the mountain, then go on.
If you wanna take the highest sight of the view, then go on.
If you wanna run, then run.
If you wanna eat, then eat.
If you don't wanna do anything, then rest.
Don't think too much, just do it.
And you'll find, you are the best one in the world, you deserve the whole world, no one can beat you in your battlefield.
