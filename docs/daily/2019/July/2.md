If an idea was born in your mind, my dear, then it will sprout into a tree, a giant tree.
That is the awfullest thing in the world. You will enforce yourself to convince that is true. That is the right thing to do. That is the reason why you live in the world.
Oh, well, my pal, as the old saying, actually it is only said by me, "If you wanna do something, do it. don't think twice."
Yesterday I had a dreadful dream.
Once again, I was flying in the sky, and someone wanna murder me, and I don't know who is him or her.
