I lost something recently.
The enthusiasm to photography. I used be a super fans of photography, I mean. I love the way that I create something. I mean, in my own way. Only me, myself, can create something like this.
This weekend, two of my friends, also were my middle-school classmate, will come to visit me. I shall bring some good pics for them.
Everybody live in a boring life. We shall spark it by ourservles.
Suck it!
Everybody wanna fuck somebody.
Fuck it!
