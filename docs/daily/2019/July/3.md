What a coincidence thing is: the No. of the month is the exact No. of the week. Which I mean is 1st is Monday and Tuesday is the 2nd and so forth and so on.
And tomorrow will be my 22nd Birthday in the Western calendar.
What recently troubled me is I can't focus on one thing, and can't follow the schedule that I made before. But yesterday I did go outside and do some workout. And it made me feel that is so fantastic!
I'm afraid, that I will stay in this situation for a long time.
Everyone said that they, themselves wanna better life, but stuck in the same problem. Year after years, same one. 
Sometimes I do need some space to get chill and self-reflection.
I think if you do the right thing. I mean, don't feel guilty about your work, as long as you finished your job, and don't waste your time during the work, you can reward yourself a medal. Let others be others. I am who I am.
Actually, I love    sports, I do love sports which I do.
Like skateborading, climbing, bicycling, running etc.
The company give you a opportunity to grow and you should not never to give it up.
