Yesterday, I went to Aunt's home for lunch. She talks with me a lot with her old tale stories. Her childhood, how she went to school without breakfast. I'm kind of regret now, I shall talk much with her, instead of watch the online course.
I should learn something from Ed.
First of all: prioritize all of your things.
Then finished it one by one by sort.
And I didn't finish the one papper per week. And I didn't control myself. And I don't feel guilty anymore. And I don't like that feeling, that's true.
