This week, I do it well.
List all the stuff that I should proud of myself.
1. Do not use Wechat during work. (and others app for killing time)
2. Workout each day. (e.g. 50 lifts etc)
3. Start to add Learn Japnese to my daily life. (more than 10 mins, will add more time in future)
4. Get up early (The latest one is 6 AM, the earliest one is: 4.30 AM)
5. Start to eat boiled eggs and banana each day.
All these healthy habits keep me have a good mood so that I can work efficiently.
But I should do more work to make myself more confident? Which means I won't be mess up my life again.

What I wanna do is still not clear, but I think I shouldn't be too hurry, I can enjoy the moment, and till the time it comes, I will do it with 100 percent faith.
