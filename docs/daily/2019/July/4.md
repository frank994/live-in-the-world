:(
Yesterday I did it once again. After I finished my workout at home, this feeling is so strong, desire for sex. It has become a trouble of my life. Yes, Even it is not oftenly, but I do felt guilty after I repeat it.
It's time for change, do not do it again.
Back to the one year ago, you said you gonna set up a big faith on Japanese or Spanish, but both of them, you were failed. Shame on you.
You wanna said that 'I wish I study hard before...' aftet ten years later??? Huh? Won't you regreat all of these that you won't push yourself harder?
Have a healthy body, have a healthy mind, a calm, clear mind to keep youself think.
