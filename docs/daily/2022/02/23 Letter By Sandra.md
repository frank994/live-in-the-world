Hola Hola Frank:
    First of all, I would like to thank you. This is an endless list. I would like to mention the most important and meaningful aspects for me:
        a) Thank you for replying to me, you have always been very considerate towards myself(?).
        b) Thank you for being honest with me I appreciate when you looked at me on the eyesand changed your face. Then I know you didn't like something I did or said. So I'm a very serious way, you told me so.
        c) Thank you for caring of me so much. Because of xxx xxx, I am net ibed(??) to this. You are the first guy who behaves like this with me. You made me feel very special.
        d) Thank you for sharing everything with me, no matter what.
        e) Thank you for making me being part of your own world. (family, friends, hiking, climbing, camping...)
        f) Thank you for bringing hapiness and joy to my simple life.
        g) Thank you for showing life from a dilleneat(??) perspective.
        h) Thank you for giving me warm(during camping night), protection (during Shuangqiao valley hike) and love (all the time, but specially when I was getting sick in Jinxian).

        Secondly, as we talked before, in my opnion, the 3 most important pillars of any kind of relationship/friendship are:
        a) Communication
        b) Respect
        c) Honesty

        So, when I think of you and the reasons why I like you too, I also have manyl, but those 3 are essential and you got them all!
        a) We could chat about any topic for hours and we enjoyed.
        b) You respected my space, my ideas, my habits and my character.
        c) You were totally honest and imcore(??) with me from the first day until now.
        d) You have good, strong and clear value in your heart and you are loyal to them, you follow them. Never leave them apart.
        e) You are full of passion. If you like something, you go until the end. Keep this spirit, please.
        f) You are helpful and obbraing(???) with everyone around you.

        However, we laced(??) some diglence(??) between us, due to culture, habits, orimions(??), ideas... Besides, there was some distance between us, but maybe I would have kissed you, just needed some more time.
        Who knows what would have happened in the future, but one thing I am sure about: I am very lucky to have met you at 塘朗 in Shenzhen and you have been and are part of my life.

        Thirdly, I truly feel happy for you. New that you met another girl and you are going to get to know each other.
        In my opnion, people who like each other and care about the other people, will let him/her be happy. So if you are happy and full of joy with her, I'm pleased too.
        Besides, it's good for you to move on, move forward, so I wish you all the best together. You deserve to be happy and be loved; I am sure she also deserves you. I hope you introduce her to me some time in the future :).

        Finally, you will always be in my heart and part of my life. You just need to popup en Wechat or give me a call. I'll be there as your friend. I know you don't usually ask for help, but friends help each other. I'll be always there, so please reach me out if I can give you a hand.

            Give you a big and warm hug.( as the first one I gave you when we met at Jinxian the first time.)
            May we meet again.
            See you somewhere sometime, 阿鹤.
