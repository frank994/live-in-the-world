A half of 19 has passed.
What did you do in the last six months? I have no idea.
For summurize my last Month, which is June.
I saw the power of ocean wave, the big wave.
I lost something in June.
But I got anothers in the same time.
One of my favorite movie is: Into the Wild, which described a man who choose to live in the wild instead of society.
What touched me is, the true of the life, what is the meaning of the life? Wear proper suit and work in the building? Eat delicious food and die in a fantastic hospital? I say no. 100 percent freedom is what I wanna, no society, no burder, no chain, no relationship, no connection with anybody.
I'd rather die, if I live without freedom.
