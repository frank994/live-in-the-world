Another simple day of my life.
I found that me, myself waste too much time to have chat with other people, girls or others. DO YOU DO LIKE IT? Like this feeling? 
Everyone will be distracted by other little things. And we can't focus on one thing all day long. But the most ridiculous thing is: only you can keep your attenton focus on the thing, the thing you're doing it, during your work or study. Then it would be most efficient.
Sorry, what did you say? Say it again. Loudly. You said you wanna some rest for relax your feeble energy? You said you only can refill it after you get comfortable warm hug. That's all excuse for your laziness. You've already behind the people.
