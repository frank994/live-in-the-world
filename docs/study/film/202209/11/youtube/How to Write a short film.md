(fantastic short film since it has a strong philosophical conflict good structure and an ending that works perfectly) 

NOTES:
a short film needs:
- philosophical dilemmas
- ethical dilemmas
- moral dilemmas

good dramas have characters that
- a character struggling with their own beliefs as they come into contact with the world

One of the biggest important elements of a good drama is that characters action must be challenged characters heading towards what they want or getting what they want should always come at a cost this keeps the conflict heightened
