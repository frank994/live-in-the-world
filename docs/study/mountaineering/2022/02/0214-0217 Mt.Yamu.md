| Difficulty(难度) | Easy+(简单+)        | 做为一个入门级别的5k雪山，总体来说还是很友好，这也是会选择它的原因 |
| 海拔             | 5336                | 徒步起点到大本营是缓长的坡，大概6km左右，大本营到山脊是碎石坡，随后便是暴露感强的山脊（岩石➕雪），BC -> Summit大概是3km，爬升800m左右 |
| 风格             | 徒步+简单的岩石攀登 | 雪线在5000米左右，但我们避开了大部分的雪线，直到最后一百多米才踩上了雪 |



队伍组成：Benjamin、小文、阿鹤（我）

## Experience



### Disadvantage

- **Didn't use the safer way to through the MIX ROUTE**: we did bring the rope, hareness and crampons, but we didn't use them in the end, just free solo.

  **For Xiaowen**: shouldn't drop the ice-axe at the beginning of the mixed-route, **YOU CAN NOT MAKE A STOP WHEN FALLING**

  > Should use the rope in the mix-route, and Xiaowen should bring a summit package bigger, rope should always be with us(as a emergence rescue preventation)

- **Spent too much time on breakfirst**: we did spent almost 2.5hrs to cook breakfirst, get up at 6.30, take off at 9

  > Instead of melt snow, we should boil some water one night before, so that we can melt ice, which will be more efficient, and bring the gas can into the sleeping gas 15 mins in advance(before use it)

- **Climbing pace**: just too fast! you shouldn't take climbing as a marathon

  > take more time to the elevation adaptation, and take a rest, be prepared, enough sleeping time, enough energy, after that, depart

  And shoulnd't take too much break, you will feel cold or disturb your climbing pace

- **Didn't bring enough gas**: we only brought one can of gas with us, it did run out in the end, if we have to spent another night in the mountain(base camp), we'll be f**ked up

  > Just bring enough gas and with extra one

- **Winter Camping Stuff didn't sufficient**: should bring more sleeping pad,

### Advantage

- A team is more stronger than a single person: I didn't carry the camping stuff & the public technic stuff with me, which is more easy to me
