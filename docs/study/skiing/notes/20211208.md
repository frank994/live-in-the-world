# Skiing in Koktokay

Teached Aqiu in the morning.

It's hard to do it in one hand, and teach it in the other hand.

It's very important to feel the feeling that the body gives or response to you,  and express it to the others.

Tried to pulling the ski board. Feeling good.

Everybody has its own problem. need to make a specific plan for each one.
