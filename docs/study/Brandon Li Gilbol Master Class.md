  #### How to Smoothly move your gimbal
  
  > Return to Home before Each Shot
  
  Slow Start, Fast in the middle, Slow in the end
  
  > Your Gimbal will give you the smoothest in Home Position
  
  - You can Improve Smoothness by not inverting gimbal during shot
  
    Lower your body, and raise your body.
  
  **Use your body, instead of Gimbal Enginee.**
